# General Interview tips

Be confident, sound responsible and the interview will be a cakewalk.

### Introduction

Keep it ready, don't try to make it impromptu. Whatever is on your resume should resonate through your short introduction. If you want to have emphasis on some part (your fortes) of your resume during the interview, make sure to highlight it in your introduction.
After the intro they should be clear of either the following things
a. You have a specific domain interest in "xyz" for which the company has as a domain/department.
b. If the company does not have that "xyz" domain (opening), they will question your ability to learn a new domain according to availability, in short amount of time.

### DSA

Here, what is more important than actually solving the question is putting forth your thought process. If its right, then even if you don't actually solve the question,
the interviewer will be confident that your thought train was in the right direction ( you can reason appropriately)
and they will be happy to guide you on how to solve that problem with some hints.
Generally even if you don't know how to completely solve a problem, just try to solve it in your way, even if it is slightly wrong ..
then the interviewer will hint you towards a better solution , then pick that up explain around it.
Never say "No, I can't solve this". keep continuing until they are bored or have got what they wanted.

### Resume and the Projects on your Resume

The interview generally revolves around your resume , they want to know what you are good at and whether you are passionate about it.
So whatever is on your resume, you should have complete knowledge about it, otherwise it sends forward a bad impression that you have put something up on your resume and you are not aware of it.
For example I had unknowingly placed Java lang as the first language from left in the list of languages I know,
not realizing that the interviewer would think its in order from best to worst. So they started with asking me about the latest java version
and I had to guess my way out by telling the version number I use.

### HR Round

They want to understand you better in this round, there is no right or wrong answer. They will judge you for your consistency with the principles you showcase during the interview. Try to match the
interviewer's vibe. They not only want a great software engineer but also a friendly and enthusiastic colleague who will fit in the team just right.
Your communication skills and you being open matters a lot more than you would think.
For example on the last day of my internship my manager shared his story of interviewing two candidates for a position. One was extremely talented in problem solving and development
but lacked the communication/socializing skills. The other candidate wasn't as stellar as the first but could communicate his ideas well.
Guess what? The HR team pushed my manager to hire the second candidate for the overall performance (remember that the interviews are holistic?).
In conclusion he stated, the reasoning behind doing so is simple, in a corporate workspace, the first candidate would succeed rapidly as an individual (solo),
but the second candidate will push his entire team towards success.

### Yolo principle

Suppose they ask you about "xyz" and you don't have a complete idea about it, still, you can always speak about something parallel to it which is related to "xyz" in some way by saying "I am not that sure about "xyz" but, it works based on "pqr"/ supports "pqr" -> explain "pqr". Basic idea is to say something instead of keeping completely quiet. Who knows, they might change the flow to ask you further on pqr if they find your fundamentals are strong with it. The interview happens only once and you want to create an impression that although you don't know about some minor things, you know the majority of them.

### General tips

1. Make sure the questions they ask are clear to you , if not don't hesitate to have them repeat it for you..sometimes the interviewers themselves aren't sure how to state it in the first go.
2. Every part of the interview is judged separately, if something bad/good happens only at the end/start doesn't mean it will affect the entire interview marks, so stay chill throughout the interview.
3. Make sure they remember you after the interview, you should leave some positive impact on them during the interview which makes them select you over the others when they recall the interview in case of a tie for example.

This is a generic template, ask the person that forwarded this link to you in case you have any more doubts!
